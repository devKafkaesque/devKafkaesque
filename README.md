# Welcome to My GitHub Profile

Hello, I’m Vishist Parashar—a dedicated full-stack developer and game development enthusiast with a knack for solving problems and building next-level applications. When I’m not busy making the web (and my workplace!) a better place, I’m busy cooking up some seriously cool projects.

## Featured Projects

- **Insurance ChatBot (crewAI)**  
  InsuranceBotFlow is an AI-powered chatbot application built with CrewAI that helps users interact with their insurance claims data. The system can process natural language queries to retrieve claim information and is designed to be extensible for additional insurance-related operations.
